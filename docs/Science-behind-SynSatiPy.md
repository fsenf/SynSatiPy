# Science behind SynSatiPy

Earlier version of the SynSat interface were utilized for scientific studies with various research targets, for instance to

- assess the realism of cloud characteristics in super high-resolution ICON simulations over Germany (https://doi.org/10.1002/qj.2947)

- investigate SynSat uncertainties in the presence of Cirrus clouds (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosres.2016.08.012)

- characterize quality weather forecasts of deep convective development (https://doi.org/10.1175/MWR-D-16-0480.1)
